# Piece's move rules

Each piece in chess has a different move rule. Here's all the move rules.

## King

The king is pretty simple, it can move 1 square in all direction.

## Queen

The queen is kinda like the king, it can move in all direction, but it can move however many squares it wants.

## Bishop

The bishop can move diagonally however many squares it wants.

## Knight

The knight is a little more complicated. For each direction, it can moves 2 blocks forward and 1 block left or right, kinda like an L shape.

## Rook

The rook moves straight in 4 directions however many squares it wants

## Pawn

The pawn is the trickiest one. It can only move 1 square forward. However, for it's first move, it can optionally move 2 square forward, then it can only move 1 square forward. And the pawn can only capture an enemy's piece 1 block forward diagonally. Additionally, there's a weird move called *en passant*. If an enemy pawn has moved 2 squared up to right next to our pawn horizontally, we can capture the pawn by moving our pawn 1 square forward diagonally.

## Castling

If neither the king nor the rook of either side has been moved, then *castling* is a legal option. When we castle, the king will move 2 square to either side, with the rook moving to the other side of the king.
